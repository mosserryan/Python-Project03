# Python-Project03

Python GUI project where the users needs to find the treasure!

For both PROJECT 02 (RPG) and PROJECT 03 (FLASK)

NOTE: CSS is messy but usable, not optimized for all screen sizes. Had to remove a good chunk of the code. Made sure the project is at least operational. Some of the code became messy. I found better way to write alot of it, but instead of changing it, I went with the "save me time" route and continued down the path of messy code. Sorry Chad!

WISHLIST: I misjudged how much I could do, but I was aiming to have stats, different weapons, levels, battles, sadly I needed to scrap the unfinished code :(

**SPOILERS
Find a weapon, slay the monster, grab a key to unlock the door!
